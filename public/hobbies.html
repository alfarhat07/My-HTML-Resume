<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  I have many different hobbies, and they mostly revolve around arts and
  computers. Here are a few of them specifically:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>
      I really like drawing, more specifically I enjoy portraying characters,
      people, many different faces that come up to my mind when I'm drawing.
    </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
      Coding and playing around with programming languages is something I
      particularly quite like, as I really enjoy learning new ways to solve
      problems or bring ideas to life.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Crocheting</h2>
    <p>
      Crocheting is a skill I picked up shortly after the pandemic, after
      realising how easy it is to start, and the man things you can do with it,
      such as mini plushies, hats and other art pieces.

</ul>
